# READ BEFORE TRANSLATING

### TRANSLATE ONLY JSON VALUES, NOT THE KEYS
### ONLY TRANSLATE VALUES THAT ARE ENCLOSED IN DOUBLE-QUOTES

EXAMPLES:
---


```json
{
    "key" /* don't translate this */: "value" /* translate this */
}
```
```json
{
    "key" /* don't translate this */: true, /* don't translate this because its not enclosed in double quotes */
    "key2" /* don't translate this */: 17 /* don't translate this because its a number */
}
```
